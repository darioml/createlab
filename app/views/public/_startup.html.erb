        <p>If you find an idea that you think you could form a business around then we can provide tailored help to get it off the ground as a viable alternative to a graduate job. Due to cost and the fact that <b>we don't take equity</b> we are limited to 30 ventures per year so you will need to prove that there is customer interest. If you don't already know how test interest before building anything keep an eye out for the business skills workshops. <b>Apply by talking to any of the team at events.</b></p><br>
        <blockquote>Fact: Last year over 200 teams entered the pitch event and 30 of those are still on their way to changing the future and have raised over Â£1m so far.</blockquote>
